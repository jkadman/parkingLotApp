## Parking Lot Management System for Java

This app is the next step in my learning how to use Java for development.  I started with a project learning the basic syntax of the language (see my Java basics repo [here](https://github.com/jkadman/learnJava)).
Now I am moving onto doing this parking lot management app using command line.

This project is based off of the Free Code Camp article located [here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/java-project-parking-lot-management-system/).
